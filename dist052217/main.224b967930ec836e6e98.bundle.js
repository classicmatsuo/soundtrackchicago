Blues music itself can be traced back to the triangle trade of the seventeenth century and rooted in the emancipation of the African slaves.  The Africans, who crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the bottom of slave ships brought their distinct music with them. This music was first heard in the fields of servitude as work songs, hollers and arhoolies. These rhythms were used to help the slaves overcome the hardship of working in the fields, from the Piedmont region of the southeast to the cotton fields of the Deep South. The National Geological Society defines the Mississippi Delta Region as the land from Mobile, Alabama to Galveston, Texas with its pinnacle in Memphis, Tennessee. The blues delta itself is the area made up by the confluence of the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers. It is in the blues delta region where the music of Charley Patton, Son House, Robert Johnson, and Muddy Waters originated on the Dockery and Stovall plantations. It was also in the blues delta region where boogie-woogie piano played a significant role in the Turpentine towns. These blues traveled from the Deep South to the south and west sides of Chicago during the Great migration starting in 1916; today, blues music thrives primarily in the clubs of Chicago’s north side.\n\t\t        </p>\n\t\t        <p>\n\t\t          While the blues can be found throughout the Delta, the music and culture progressed north, giving a voice to the African American community when they migrated to Chicago’s Bronzeville during the early part of the twentieth century. It was in the south side brownstones where house parties were prevalent during the twenties and thirties. The piano playing of Jimmy “Papa” Yancey influenced boogie-woogie icons Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis who would bring this rocking rhythm to New York’s Carnegie Hall in 1938 at the “Spirituals to Swing concert” produced by John Hammond. These house parties provided the music that kept a community together through a time of racial strife, through the Race Riots of 1919, and through the Great Depression. Chicago became the “music capital of the world,” and home to musical greats like King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Jimmy Noone and many other greats during the twenties and thirties. The music can be heard up and down the south side “stroll.” A known myth was if you just held up a horn at the intersection of 31st and Grand blvd. the greatest jazz could be heard from that horn. Throughout Bronzeville there were many theaters, cabarets, and cafes. In many homes of the black belt, house parties were held as community rituals, which helped the residents bind together to overcome life’s adversity.\n\t\t        </p>\n\t\t        <p>\n\t\t          This foundation made Chicago the “Mecca” or the “Promised Land.” Chicago became a recording center for the musicians, particularly the blues musicians of the south side as well as for many of the southern musicians that would travel north for the opportunity to record. The port of entry was Maxwell Street where Papa Charlie Jackson lived and sang of life in the market. The headquarters at the time was at 35th and State the home of Tampa Red, the Guitar Wizard Tampa Red, the Guitar Wizard’s. It was here a clique of musicians would congregate, rehearse and wait for record producer Lester Melrose to hear these rehearsals and provide the musicians with the opportunity to record. These recording sessions would be commonly referred to as the “Bluebird” sound. The sessions by Tampa, Sonny Boy Williamson #1, Merline Johnson, and Big Bill Broonzy provided the Chicago Blues sound that became the basis for the Chicago blues recording legacy.\n\t\t        </p>\n\t\t        <p>\n\t\t          The “Bluebird” sound became the standard for blues recording, showcasing vocalists, guitar players, piano players, harmonica players, and horn ensembles. This music popularized the blues to the community of the south side and influenced the African American record buying public from coast to coast. As a result a market for the blues was created. Although there was a recording ban during World War II the scene was set for Chicago to become a center for independent record production in the Post War era. With the coming of the Atomic Age came the explosion of Chicago’s electric blues scene. The south side had dozens of blues clubs that provided the platform for the numerous musicians moving to the industrial city in the north after the war. It was an outlet for the booming African American community that not only filled the south side black belt but then moved west from Maxwell Street down Lake and Madison streets.\n\t\t        </p>\n\t\t        <p>\n\t\t          With the advent of the Post War era, African American recording blues performers brought their music from the south to the industrial north. The music changed with the times and could be heard on the streets of Maxwell Street and then recorded by Bernard Abrams for his Ora Nelle Records, which was located at his Maxwell Street Radio and Record shop. The label only operated for a couple of years but it was at his studio where Little Walter first recorded. The blues business became an important Chicago industry when Leonard and Phil Chess, brothers and Polish immigrants, left the scrap yards of the south side and laid the tracks for the archetype of Chicago blues and the foundation for Rock and Roll. Chess moved their operation from South Cottage Grove Avenue to 2120 S. Michigan Avenue in the area that would later be known as Record Row. The label featured some of the greatest blues performers in blues history. The label became the home for Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Etta James, Koko Taylor and many more post war blues performers.\n\t\t        </p>\n\t\t        <p>\n\t\t          Following in the footsteps of Chess Records, Vee Jay Records was formed. Vee Jay, the African American owned and operated label run by Vivian Carter and Jimmy Bracken featured the recordings of Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker, and the Staple Singers. The label featured artists that not only were blues, but gospel and even in the sixties distributed recordings by the Beatles and the Four Seasons. The industry flourished throughout the fifties. Independent labels like Parrot, J.O.B., and Cobra set the standard for the electric Chicago blues sound featuring artists like Snooky Pryor, Sunnyland Slim, Otis Rush and Magic Sam. Chicago set the standard for record production, radio play, and distribution for the modern blues scene. Record Row on south Michigan Avenue not only provided headquarters for the labels but record distributors like the Leaner brothers, United Records. Record Row was the music capital of Rhythm and Blues. \n\t\t        </p>\n\t\t        <p>\n\t\t          The sixties brought a dramatic cultural shift to the blues community. Not only was the nation going through social upheaval, but the blues scene was going through a social change. At a time when the African American community was looking towards Afro-centric sounds of experimental jazz, blues became a cross-cultural expression for the young white audience, both as listeners and performers. The founding of Delmark Records by Bob Koester and the opening of live blues clubs on north Wells street created a whole new audience for the blues. Delmark gave a voice to artists like Junior Wells, Magic Sam, Jimmy Dawkins, Luther Allison, Jimmy Johnson, and J.B. Hutto. The discs could be sold at the Jazz Record Shop, which became the center for all those who loved the blues. Labels like Alligator, Earwig and The Sirens were all bit by the blues bug and released records by new or under appreciated artists like Hound Dog Taylor, the Jelly Roll Kings or masters like Homesick James, David Honey Boy Edwards, Sunnyland Slim, and Erwin Helfer. These labels kept the blues flame burning so the next generation would have a place to release their music. Artists like Toronzo Cannon, Sharon Lewis, Linsey Alexander, and Mike Wheeler are now keeping the blues alive for the twenty-first century.\n\t\t        </p>\n         "}]}],t.name.next("Blues’n In

This spiritual force was birthed in Chicago’s underground music scene in the late 70’s and early 80’s in the iconic club The Warehouse. The music brought together cultures, races, ages and alternative orientations like no other medium of that day.\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe story of the House Music in Chicago is not short, nevertheless this summary pays homage to the pioneers both dead and alive and the great Chicago institutions that nurtured the genres rise, aided in its fall and supported its resurgence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlack Music Past shapes Chicago’s Black Music Future\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe sounds of Soul Music from artists like James Brown took a turn in 1967 to a “four-on-the-floor” rhythm that led to the birth of funk, R&B and disco. By the mid 70’s, European influences using electronic sounds from the German group Kraftwerk and disco hit’s including “I Feel Love” from Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder changed the city and the country’s tone from Civil Rights to Human Rights and the music followed suit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago “House Music” was aptly named for the underground members-only gay club The Warehouse located at 208 South Jefferson. Owner and Businessman Robert Williams arrived from New York City to Chicago and brought the legendary Frankie Knuckles to create a powerful sound-system-fueled dance music scene at what was then an almost empty three story West Loop warehouse. The demise of American disco, a decidedly Black, Gay and Drug associated music form, created an opportunity for those alternative communities to build a new sound and a new era of collaboration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago House Music Desegregates\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ Frankie Knuckles was a Chicago area superstar when the Warehouse closed in 1982. By 1983, the election of Chicago’s first Black Mayor, Harold Washington created an energy and optimism in Chicago’s youth and alternative communities. Mr. Williams opened a new club The Music Box and in 1983 Frankie took his fame and followers to his own club the Powerplant at 1015 North Halsted.  Like the Warehouse, these Chicago addresses in the late 70’s and early 80’s were industrial, dark and empty, under-the-radar and perfect for after-hour events. These clubs and the sounds that emerged brought teens and twenty-something straight kids together with Black, Gay, Latino and White adults all immersed in lyrics that suggested they should “Bring Down the Walls” and “Brighter Days” were to come. More explicit content included in songs like “Baby Wants to Ride” and “Waiting on My Angel” unified the DJ and dancers in spirit and in movement. The songs were hopeful as was the era. Gays were open and free in a space where straights did not judge, stare or become violent. Blacks, Whites, Asians and Hispanics became one with the music and in-turn created an atmosphere where unity was bigger than difference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Chicago DJ Becomes the Star\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago area superstars included DJ Ron Hardy, the resident DJ at the new club the Music Box on 16th & South Indiana, the DJ’s of Chicago radio station WBMX’s Hot Mix 5 including Farley “JackMaster” Funk, Mickey "Mixin" Oliver, Ralphi Rosario, Kenny "Jammin" Jason, and Scott "Smokin" Silz, the creator of the House Music Anthem “Move Your Body” DJ/producer Marshall Jefferson, the House group Fingers Inc. which included DJ and producer Larry Heard, vocalist Robert Owens “Mystery of Love”, DJ Jesse Saunders and Musician Vince Lawrence who pressed the first vinyl House Music record “On and On” in 1984 , vocalist and producer Jamie Principle and DJ/artist/producer Steve “Silk” Hurley whose 1986 hit “Jack Your Body” became the first Chicago House Music artist to have a song hit number one on the UK charts. The DJs used turntables and beat machines including the iconic Roland 808 to launch music careers that many of these ordinary Chicagoans could never have imagined.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago House Music though made popular by the early DJs was largely driven into the communities by the radio stations, record stores and teenage word of mouth. Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy’s sounds influenced teenagers at Chicago area high schools including Kenwood Academy in Hyde Park - 5015 South Blackstone Avenue, Lindblom Technical in Englewood - 6130 South Wolcott Ave. and Mendel Catholic in Roseland - 111th St & S King Drive. The talent and creativity from South and West Side youth became evident as basement beats led to the brilliance of teenage DJs, vocalists and producers including Kim Salter (K/Joy) “Like This” - Kenwood Academy, Producer/Filmmaker Irwin Eberhart (Chip E.) “If You Only Knew” - Kenwood Academy, heralded female DJ Lori Branch - Lindblom Technical and West Side DJ phenom Gene Hunt - Farragut High. Mendel Catholic High School has a special place in House Music History in that its Mendel Bi-Level parties held from 1976 to 1988 launched the careers of many now heralded House Music DJ’s. Thousands of kids from around the city travelled to Mendel to dance to House Music for over a decade. The founder and producer of the event, Kirkland Townsend who raised millions of dollars for his alma mater, later became the business manager for the legendary DJ Collective “The Chosen Few’s” DJ Jesse Saunders and DJ Wayne Williams and later a radio personality in New York City. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago Supports its New Industry\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago area radio stations, record stores and record labels including Trax Records (using the old Chess Records pressing equipment) and DJ International were also instrumental in bringing House Music to Chicago area youth. The high powered WBMX 102.7FM in Chicago was the first to highlight Chicago House Music prominently in its weekly rotation. Rarely heralded yet critical marketing for DJ’s, promoters and producers were Chicago’s College radio stations including WNUR 89.3FM, Northwestern University’s Streetbeat show which began highlighting House and Hip Hop Music to the north shore and north suburbs in 1983, WHPK 88.5FM University of Chicago’s radio station and WKKC 89.3FM, Kennedy King Community College’s evening show whose signal reached the south side neighborhoods. WNUR’s T. Chablis (Tim Harris) and WKKC’s PinkHouse became important Chicago area radio personalities by creating events and collaborating with artists. Record stores including Importes Etc. (711 South Dearborn), Wax Trax, Loop Records and Gramaphone Records on the north side are credited with shortening the name of the club The Warehouse, to music heard at “The House,” creating a DJ culture that sold millions of vinyl records throughout Chicago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1988 House Music Party Promotion Poster | Courtesy of @DanceMusicFound – Gene Hunt Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago’s small venues and clubs including the Playground in Chicago’s South Loop, Jeffery Pub in South Shore (one of the longest running gay clubs in the country) C.O.D’s and AKA’s in Rogers Park the Hyde Park Athletic Club, and many others that have come and gone kept the music alive over the years. The late 80’s and 90’s saw increasing attacks on the underground music scene which was the backbone of the genre. The AIDS epidemic, coupled with dance music drug culture unfortunately ended the lives of many talented artists. Finally, in 2000, Chicago’s City Council enacted an ordinance banning unlicensed dance parties which slowly silenced DJs and promoters forcing them to find new opportunities across the country. Thanks to the overseas success of DJ Frankie Knuckles and the proliferation of cassette tapes, increasing technology, over and under-the-table label deals by label owners Rocky Jones and their representatives including Attorney Jay B. Ross, House Music exploded in Europe providing gigs as artists, executives and remixers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApril 2000 Chicago City Council Anti-Rave Ordinance | Courtesy of @DanceMusicFound\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago politics and Chicago’s mostly segregated neighborhoods shaped how House Music flourished, exploded overseas, then died in its neighborhoods. The proliferation of digital and emerging electronic mediums has catapulted House Music from its Chicago roots into a global power influencing dance, fashion and media. Chicagoans have mastered the genre winning Grammy’s and chart topping hits with international artists including Michael Jackson and most recently Kanye West. Unlike early Chicago culture, in the House Music era, sexuality and heritage were not a deterrent to creativity and learning. This ideology and its transformative muscle has thrust House Music to its current massive pop presence and will undoubtedly continue to drive its future.\n\t\t         \t'}]}]}],t.name.next("Chicago

On the city’s South and West Sides, African American gospel music was first written, arranged, performed, recorded, and broadcast, forever changing the sound of the African American church.  \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The gospel music story starts with the Great Migration.  Beginning around 1916, African Americans left the South to make a better life for themselves, and Chicago was a popular destination.  Migrants brought with them their beloved hymns, camp meeting songs, and spirituals.  Their singing and musicianship drew largely from traditional West African ceremonial practices that their ancestors passed along through oral tradition.  These techniques included falsetto, polyrhythms, handclapping and foot patting, improvisation, and call-and- response congregational singing.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Migrants found some quality of life in Chicago, but they also encountered a more insidious form of prejudice from whites as well as some establishment blacks who seemed embarrassed by their brethren.  Moreover, Chicago’s major black Protestant churches had long abandoned religious folk music for the staid hymnody of their white denominational counterparts.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Feeling like strangers in a strange land, migrants clung tightly to their southern traditions, including their soul-stirring worship practices.  They stole away to the city’s Pentecostal, Holiness, and Spiritual churches, where familiar worship experiences reigned supreme.  Two of these South Side churches, All Nations Pentecostal and First Church of Deliverance, were among the first African American churches in the nation to broadcast their worship services on radio.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Songwriter, arranger, and pianist Thomas A. Dorsey migrated from Atlanta to Chicago in the early 1920s.  He began writing gospel songs that were steeped in the southern tradition but swung to the vaudeville blues and jazz he performed for a living.  To his dismay, no pastor of a big Chicago Protestant church wanted Dorsey’s so-called “jazz baby” music in his sanctuary.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              That is, until 1932, when Dr. J. H. L. Smith arrived from Birmingham, Alabama, to lead Chicago’s Ebenezer Baptist Church.  Smith grew up in the southern religious music tradition.  He hired Mississippi-born Theodore Frye to start a group at Ebenezer that sang songs “of the southland.”  Frye asked his friend Dorsey, by now having modest success with his gospel songs, to help him assemble the first modern gospel chorus at Ebenezer.  When the chorus debuted to great accolades in January 1932, many Chicago Protestant churches now wanted a gospel chorus.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              That included Pilgrim Baptist Church, which hired Dorsey to organize its gospel music program.  Ebenezer replaced Dorsey with Arkansas migrant Roberta Martin.  Martin formed the Roberta Martin Singers from members of Ebenezer’s junior choir.  Between 1933 and 1969, the Roberta Martin Singers were one of the nation’s foremost gospel groups.  Martin’s semi-classical imprint on songwriting and arrangements is the linchpin of the “Chicago School of Gospel.”\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Tragedy struck in August 1932, when Dorsey’s young wife Nettie died in childbirth and their newborn died a day later.  Dorsey channeled his grief into composing “Take My Hand, Precious Lord.”  “Precious Lord” became one of the most beloved gospel songs of all time and a favorite of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Dorsey was now the nation’s top gospel songwriter.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In 1933, Dorsey, Frye and Magnolia Lewis Butts organized the first national convention of gospel choruses.  Sallie Martin, considered the Mother of Gospel Music, traveled from coast to coast, establishing gospel choruses for the convention and, as an employee of Dorsey’s publishing firm, sold Dorsey sheet music to the newly-minted ensembles.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Bronzeville became an epicenter of gospel music publishing.  In the late 1930s, Roberta Martin formed a publishing concern.  Sallie Martin parted ways with Dorsey and joined Kenneth Morris in opening Martin and Morris Music.  For decades, Martin and Morris was the nation’s most successful African American music publishing company.  Frye started his own publishing company, as did singer Myrtle Jackson, the First Church of Deliverance, and several others.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Gospel became big business in 1947 when Mahalia Jackson, the Queen of Gospel, recorded “Move On Up a Little Higher.”  The Chicagoan’s single became a best seller and encouraged record company executives to sign other local gospel talent.  These included Alex Bradford (“Too Close to Heaven”), James Cleveland (“Grace is Sufficient”), the Gay Sisters (“God Will Take Care of You”), and the Caravans (“Mary Don’t You Weep”).  Featuring Albertina Walker, the second Queen of Gospel, the Caravans were an all-star group; every member was a seasoned soloist.  Roebuck “Pops” Staple’s reverb-laden electric guitar, daughter Mavis’s alto voice, and the family’s haunting harmonies contributed to the Staple Singers’ popularity.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Chicago quartets were top draws during gospel’s golden age (1945-60).  These included the Soul Stirrers, Highway QCs, Pilgrim Jubilees, Christland Singers, and Salem Travelers.  Pop singers emulated their tight harmonies and choreography.  Quartet lead singers Sam Cooke, Lou Rawls, and Johnnie Taylor emerged from Chicago to become 1960s entertainment sensations.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Community choirs flourished.  The Thompson Community Singers, Wooten Choral Ensemble, South Side Community Choir, and Helen Robinson Youth Choir gave post-war adolescents a healthy out-of-school outlet and, in the process, became national recording and touring stars.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Chicago television provided a new means of disseminating gospel music across racial lines when Jubilee Showcase debuted in 1963.  Every Sunday morning for 21 consecutive years, host Sid Ordower presented national gospel artists and local talent to the Chicagoland area.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The winds shifted in 1969 when Edwin Hawkins and the Northern California State Youth Choir inadvertently scored a top five pop hit by giving an old hymn, “Oh Happy Day,” a contemporary feel.  The rise of the Hawkins Family, Andrae Crouch, and the Southern California Community Choir effectively moved the locus of gospel music from Chicago to their home in California.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              But Chicago maintains a significant presence in gospel music.  Today’s ambassadors include Anita Wilson, VaShawn Mitchell, Chicago Mass Choir, Smokie Norful, Brian Courtney Wilson, Jonathan McReynolds, Reverend Dr. Clay Evans, Reverend Charles Jenkins and Fellowship Chicago, Walt Whitman and the Soul Children of Chicago, Dexter Walker and Zion Movement, and quartets such as the Victory Travelers, Stars of Heaven, and God’s Posse.  The Stellar Awards, gospel’s top awards ceremony, was started by Chicago television entrepreneur Don Jackson.  The joyous sounds debuted by Dorsey and Frye at Ebenezer 85 years ago still reverberate in churches, auditoriums, and festivals worldwide.   -- Robert M.

And, as a bonus, you can get a few snapshots of America’s social history as well.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The earliest jazz migrated from New Orleans north. But while the first jazz recording took place in New York in 1917, it was in Chicago that the music really flowered. In the late 1910s, as jazz venues (primarily brothels) in New Orleans closed their doors, many musicians headed for Chicago, already home to thousands of transplanted African-Americans from the south: the music mirrored the Great Migration. Here the New Orleans cornet master King Oliver established his Creole Jazz Band – soon to feature the music’s first genius, Louis Armstrong – which played regularly at the Lincoln Gardens on the south side. Before long, Oliver’s music had spawned the first early-jazz offshoot, the “Austin High [School] Gang” – a group of white teenagers who emulated the music with enough variety to earn their own sobriquet.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Lincoln Gardens, which occupied the 400 block of E. 31st Street in Bronzeville, disappeared decades ago. But Tuesday nights at the Green Mill (Broadway at Lawrence), a band of young Chicagoans called The Fat Babies revisits the music created by Armstrong and the Austin High kids, with the same commitment and urgency that spurred that early jazz. And the Green Mill offers plenty of history of its own. The oldest nightclub in Chicago – and among the oldest Chicago businesses of any kind at its original location – the Mill flourished during Prohibition, when it was partly owned by one of Al Capone’s henchmen. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              By then, the music had shifted. Jazz had originally resembled a wild tapestry of different threads, with each instrument playing a separate line; by the 30s, the sound was morphing into a luxurious machine-tooled fabric, as the bands grew bigger and sleeker. New York had Duke Ellington and Kansas City had Count Basie. But a young Chicago clarinetist, Benny Goodman, assembled the orchestra that, in 1935, launched the Swing Era and created the jazz style that became America’s popular music, in the years leading out of the Great Depression and then into World War II. You won’t find too many Swing orchestras of that ilk these days. But you can find artists who, on occasion, channel the small groups that co-existed with those orchestras – artists such as reedmen Eric Schneider and Chris Madsen,  guitarists Andy Brown and Alfonso Ponticelli, vocalists Rose Colella and Kimberly Gordon – at clubs such as Andy’s (11 E. Hubbard); Winter’s (465 N. McClurg); and S.I.P. (4000 N. Southport). \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In the 1940s, Bebop – the revolution wrought by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie – supplanted Swing, and along with such offshoots as Hard-bop and Soul-jazz, it ushered in a Silver Age for jazz. This was the era of Miles Davis and John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, the Jazz Messengers, and countless others – preserved on iconic recordings for Blue Note and other noteworthy labels (including Chess Records in Chicago) – that remain a lingua franca for many modern musicians. During this time, Chicago became a revered incubator of influential tenor saxophonists: folks like Von Freeman, John Gilmore, Johnny Griffin, Eddie Harris, and Clifford Jordan. Their legacy lives on at the Jazz Showcase (806 S. Plymouth) – the world’s second-oldest jazz club under the same management – where 91-year-old proprietor Joe Segal still greets patrons at the door.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The 1960s saw social upheaval in the U.S. on an unprecedented scale, much of it centered on the historically segregated city of Chicago. The watchword was “freedom,” and jazz responded. In Hyde Park and points south, young musicians intent on experimenting with new and more open approaches to improvisation picked up on the “free jazz” work of Ornette Coleman and the expansive innovations of Cecil Taylor, John Coltrane, and one-time Chicago bandleader Sun Ra, and in 1965 formed the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. It quickly came to symbolize the second wave of the jazz avant-garde; the initials “AACM” after an artist’s name or album’s title conferred a stamp of approval for rule-busting new music. And a commanding quintet, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, became the face of the AACM throughout Europe and then the rest of the world.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In keeping with the 60s’ quest for self-determination, the AACM established a school for young musicians and sought to embody community values while raising the artistic awareness of the African-American community. And as one of the earliest musicians’ DIY efforts, the AACM offered a model for other such organizations, most notably the Black Artists Group (BAG) in St. Louis and Asian Improv Arts (AIA) in the San Francisco area. The AACM continues to this day, and affiliated artists with it perform regularly throughout the city, often at Elastic Arts (3429 W. Diversey), Constellation (3111 N. Western), Norman’s Bistro (1001 E. 43rd), and at the University of Chicago – where the Art Ensemble made one of its most famous recordings, in Mandel Hall, in 1972.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In the 1990s, the musicians of the AACM – specifically the late saxophonist and mentor Fred Anderson, whose new-music venue the Velvet Lounge still stands at 67 E. Cermak (though now a sports bar) – inspired a new wave of musicians that have once again made Chicago a global nexus for avant-garde experimentation as well as rollicking improvisation. As political and social events have leaned further right, the appetite for music that defies the establishment seems to have grown steadily larger for these artists. Names such as Ken Vandermark, Jeff Parker, Nicole Mitchell, Dave Rempis, Greg Ward, Mike Reed, Dee Alexander, Tim Daisy, and Tomeka Reid now resonate throughout the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia and Africa. Check the schedules for such hotspots as The Hungry Brain (2319 W. Belmont), the Whistler California Clipper (1002 N. California), and Logan Center at the University of Chicago – as well as Elastic Arts, Constellation, and the Green Mill – and you can take part in the next chapter in Chicago jazz even as it’s being written.\n            </p>\n         "}]}],t.name.next("Chicago Jazz")}return t.prototype.ngOnInit=function(){},t.ctorParameters=function(){return[{type:l.a}]},t}()},KXTW:function(t,n,e){"use

He was awarded the Ph.D. in 1992 after completing a dissertation: "\'Sets on the Floor\': Social Dance as an Emblem of Community in Rural Indiana."\n \t\t\t\t\t</p>\n \t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDrDosido started as an amateur folklorist by recording fiddle tunes and other traditional music in the field for a show on public radio station WIPU-Fort Wayne. Indiana Hoedown: Traditional Music from the Hoosier State ran as 26 1-hour broadcasts in 1979-80. Through the 1980s and into the \'90s he worked as a contract folklorist. He has done field research for the School of Fine Art at Eastern Illinois University, the University Museum at Southern Illinois University, the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University, the Wyoming Arts Foundation, Urban Traditions in Chicago, and the David Adler Cultural Center in Libertyville, Illinois. Paul has produced four documentary albums: Folk Songs of Illinois #2: Fiddlers; Lotus Dickey, Fiddle Tunes from Orange County, Indiana (with booklet); Lonesome Homesteader: Old Time Fiddling in Wyoming (with booklet); and Ethnic Music in Northern Indiana (for the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University).\n \t\t\t\t\t</p>\n \t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom 1988-92, Paul was on the administrative staff of the Old Town School of Folk Music as Curator of Collections and Exhibitions. Besides developing the Schools Resource Center, he also curated three exhibitions: The Making of the 5-String Banjo: From Hollowed Gourds to Silvered Rims; Weaving an Identity: Guatemalan Folk Art; and Traditional and Modern Indian Art on the Shores of Lake Michigan. Since 1990, he has taught fiddle and country music classes at the Old Town School of Folk Music, while also teaching world music and world culture courses at four Chicago universities. DrDosido currently teaches anthropology at Wilbur Wright College, part of Chicago City Colleges.\n \t\t\t\t\t</p>\n \t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href="http://drdosido.net/" target="_blank">http://drdosido.net/</a>\n \t\t\t\t\t</p>\n         '},{tabname:"Essay",title:"The National Barn Dance: Chicago and Country Music",content:'\n            <h5>By Paul L. Tyler (Dr.Dosido)</h5>\n\n            <p>\n            A strong argument can be made that Chicago was the capital of country music during the decade leading up to World War II. In the 1920s, when country–AKA hillbilly, old-time, or American folk–emerged as a separate commercial musical form, that designation of “capital” most likely belonged to Atlanta, where much early recording and radio broadcasting of rural artists took place. But Chicago began to make a strong case for itself on April 19, 1924, when brand new radio station WLS broadcast the very first National Barn Dance, with musical appearances by the pseudonymous Cowbell Pete, Kentucky Wonderbean, and fiddler “Timothy Cornrow from Ioway.” \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            \tIn the 1920s, radio broadcasting, like commercial country music, was a brand new cultural phenomenon, and Chicago was a center of explosive growth for the new medium. WLS (which stood for World’s Largest Store) was a new station begun by the Sears Roebuck Agricultural Foundation to serve the farm families of Illinois and the Midwest. Old familiar music--which is as good a definition of emergent country music as any--was a natural for helping them reach their target audience. With record-breaking cards, letters, and telegrams, rural and city audiences alike responded enthusiastically to the old-time fiddling, heart songs, and good-natured comedy that became a Saturday night staple on WLS. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            \tBy 1930, Prairie Farmer magazine had purchased WLS, and steadily built the National Barn Dance into a Depression-era media empire. Along with four to five hours of folk and vernacular music programming on the air, the Barn Dance included two 2-hour live shows at the Eighth Street Theatre (weekly sell outs from 1932 to 1957), a one-hour coast-to-coast broadcast on the NBC-Blue network, an active artist bureau that booked personal appearances for Barn Dance stars throughout a five-state region, annual WLS souvenir yearbooks and, from 1935 to 1937, a weekly fan magazine, Stand By, featuring stories and photos of Barn Dance artists. The Stars of the Saturday night program could also be heard throughout the week on WLS, and other entertainers from the weekly schedule joined the “Hayloft Gang” on Saturday nights. At the height of its popularity in the years just before and during World War II, the National Barn Dance cast numbered 70 to 100 entertainers. During this same period, the cast of WSM-Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry was about half as large. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            \tIt should be noted that from the beginning, Chicago was second only to New York as a center of production for the record industry. By the 1930s and ‘40s, some of the biggest names in country music–Bob Wills, Delmore Brothers, Bill Monroe–travelled to the Windy City to record their hits. Nationally, however, the record industry and the broadcast industry saw themselves as rivals. For instance, some country music stars on Cincinnati’s powerful WLW were booted from the airwaves for violating that station’s ban on making records. But not in Chicago, at least not for WLS. National Barn Dance stars were some of the most frequently recorded country musicians prior to 1942. Record labels like Gennett and Conqueror eagerly identified discs as recordings of National Barn Dance artists. Ironically, some of WLS’s earliest recording stars have faded into obscurity: e.g., Tommy Dandurand’s Barn Dance Fiddlers, banjo songster Chubby Parker, or the Three Little Maids (the Overstake sisters from Decatur, Illinois. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            \tSome WLS stars from the 1930s had a great deal of regional success that propelled them to great popularity at other outlets. The harmony duo of Karl & Harty and their larger ensemble, the Cumberland Ridge Runners, left WLS at the height of their popularity in the mid-30s for WLW-Cincinnati, before coming back to a long stint on the Suppertime Frolic at WJJD-Chicago. Slim Miller, the Ridge Runners’ original fiddler, became a long-time musical and comedic star for the Renfro Valley Barn Dance. The Girls of the Golden West (Milly and Dolly Good) also moved on to WLW, while the Dezurik Sisters, phenomenal yodelers, simutaneously did a series of radio transcriptions series in Nashville as the Cackle Sisters. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            \tThe best known National Barn Dance stars are a few who, after establishing themselves in Chicago, went on to make their marks in other entertainment capitals. Bradley Kincaid, a ballad singer from Kentucky, was a radio fixture in New England. Little Georgie Goebel went from being a ukulele-strumming western singer on the Barn Dance to national fame on television. The Hoosier Hot Shots, a novelty swing band led by clarinet and slide-whistle, grew a national following in Chicago that they took to California after the war. Three country and western singers who established their careers at WLS were later elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Gene Autry left Chicago in 1934 for Hollywood, while Red Foley ended up in Nashville after World War II. Patsy Montana (Rubye Blevin) spent the peak years of her career in Chicago, but was still an active performer out West until her death in 1996.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            \tStill, Chicagoans should know the National Barn Dance artists whose careers were centered in Chicago, who were deeply loved by WLS listeners and the thousands of people who streamed to the city Saturday after Saturday in hopes of getting a ticket to the live show at the Eighth Street Theatre. Topping this list are Lulu Belle & Scotty, a sweet-singing and joke-cracking husband and wife team, along with cowboy singer, fiddler, and square dance caller Arkie the Arkansas Woodchopper. Their respective tenures on the Barn Dance lasted through three full decades. Other long-time favorites included the Prairie Ramblers, a western swing band long associated with Patsy Montana, that thrived at WLS even after Patsy headed west. Like the Prairie Ramblers, whose service at WLS was interrupted by engagements in other cities, the harmony duo of Mac & Bob (Lester McFarland & Robert Gardner) were fixtures on WLS and the Barn Dance from the 1930s into the ‘50s. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            \tThis little sketch only scratches the surface. After the war, the National Barn Dance lost its country music dominance to Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry. But such notable musicians as Johnny Frigo (a jazz fiddler who did a country turn with the Sage Riders), Dolph Hewitt, the Beaver Valley Sweethearts, and Captain Stubby & the Buccaneers held forth at the Old Hayloft up through the end of the WLS National Barn Dance in 1960.  \t\n            </p>\n            Reference:\n            \tPaul Tyler.

Duranguense was born in Chicago!”, exclaims José Luis Terrazas. Terrazas, is the founder of Montez de Durango, the first band to gain world-wide renown for a style of music known as duranguense, i.e., “from Durango”. And despite a name that seems to bely origins in that northern state, duranguense is one Chicago’s own home-brewed sounds. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlong with its accompanying dance, the pasito duranguense (literally, “little step from Durango”), this style of music took the United States and then Mexico by storm in the mid-nineties. Up until that point, most U.S.born Spanish-language music had come from San Antonio, Miami, New York or Los Angeles. But duranguense, born in Chicago and inspired by Durango, rose meteorically from the mid-nineties to hold as many as five of the top 10 spots on Billboard\'s Latin charts just a decade later. Most importantly, it was not a music that emigrated from Mexico and then took roots in the U.S., but rather, emerged on this side of the Rio Grande and found its way back, always addressing audiences on both sides of the border.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago’s connection to Durango came about early in the 20th century, according to Durango historian Javier Guerrero, when Midwestern railroad companies recruited workers who were highly experienced in laying track in a state that had seen the most railroad development in Mexico at that time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a Chicago-born cultural production, duranguense emerged in a fusion of extremely local and more global sounds, as well as a bridge between tradition and modernity. On the musical side, the genre evoked three other older Mexican genres: banda, which was military-band inspired wind ensemble music, norteño, accordion-based polka-heavy tunes that evolved both north and south of the border and grupero, an 80’s sound that also was influenced in rock and cumbia - all of these in and of themselves, hybrid styles that had successfully bridged past and present, as well as rural and urban Mexico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDuranguense, however, marked a turning point for Mexican American music when it became the first genre born on the northern side of the border to become extremely popular all over Mexico.  It was a young people’s music, bringing them back in touch with the roots of the traditional music of their parents and grandparents. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt all started in the mid-nineties, when the seminal Montéz de Durango was formed by Terrazas. Terrazas, who was born in Durango, grew up in Chicago and was a percussionist in his high school marching band. Montez de Durango was the first to exploit what came to be the signature sound of duranguense: bringing together sounds produced by the drum called the tambora and its big, big sound, or tamborazo, adding a hefty dose of brass sounds (especially from the tuba), and either a melodeon or an electronic keyboard. Like many other regional Mexican musics, duranguense’s up-tempo beats also built upon on European polkas, schottisches, and waltzes.  But more than anything, duranguense sped everything up, taking the most beloved traditional elements of regional Mexican music and putting them on steroids.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMontez de Durango rose to fame with "Camino a Tepehuanes" ("Road to Tepehuanes") a song that expressed deep nostalgia as the singer returns to the mountaintop town of Tepehuanes, Durango after many years away. Similarly to “Camino a Tepehuanes”, many duranguense songs describe the immigrant lifestyle and its hardships, such as these Montez de Durango songs about leaving your son or father behind in Mexico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdding to the transnational quality of the music, many duranguense songs use Mexican agrarian imagery juxtaposed with city life as their backdrops, drawing upon both identities. Also popular in duranguense are corridos, epic songs about heroes and outlaws. As many of the musics of Northern Mexico, outlaw songs may make subtle references to the drug trade, but Terrazas comments that Montez de Durango largely avoided that scene in the band’s music.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother one of the notable characteristics of duranguense is its reliance on covers, which no doubt adds to its power to bridge an idealized past to a more difficult present. Terrazas describes how the band began to play reinvented versions of songs from favorite Durango bands such as Patrulla 81. For example, here’s a highly popular Patrulla 31 tune, “Vengo a Buscarte” which in comparison Montez de Durango’s version, loses some sweetness but gains a jauntier, polka-ish edge.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDuranguense also has a characteristic ‘look’, a style worn by band members and audience members. This includes the classic hat (known as a taco hat because of its upturned edges) accompanied by Western-wear such as colorful, chunky buckle belts and cowboy boots. Finally, the pasito duranguense, the dance that accompanies the music was also popularized by Montez de Durango with a polka of the same name composed by the band’s vocalist at the time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe band’s first two albums were a decisive moment for the commercialization of the genre as it put duranguense on the map of Latin american music.  Local Chicago bands playing cotillions, weddings, and rodeos soon incorporated the duranguense sound. Fast forward about a decade, and in August of 2004, Montez de Durango played before an audience of 50,000 at the Viva Chicago festival and received special recognition by Mayor Daley. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTerrazas founded his own Terrazas Records label and the band now has recorded more than two dozen albums. Although much of their fan base is Mexican and in the Mexican diaspora from Arizona to Alaska, the band has enormous followings in different parts of the world,  and not long ago toured Canada and Central America.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMontez de Durango also opened the doors to fame for other Chicago bands such as Alacranes Musical y Los Horóscopos de Durango. The latter band, fronted by Vicky and Marisol Terrazas, became the first regional Mexican music band to be fronted by women. Horoscopos has always innovated duranguense in many ways, even covering Cindy Lauper\'s "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" in a Spanish and English Duranguense version.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough its massive craze-level popularity was short-lived, duranguense remains one of the staple sounds of the bi-national reality of the Latin diaspora, with a widespread following of Central American as well as Mexican and Mexican-American fans. Younger generations in the U.S. still love dancing to this genre that honors the cultural ties of their parents without losing sight of their American experience. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe predominance of covers in most bands’ repertoires, sometimes noted critically, is actually a sign of duranguense’s power and magic, connecting younger people to their past through these well-known, cherished songs. Yet at the same time, duranguense encourages a contemporary dance step with an intertwined embrace, and witnesses the accelerated pace of today’s society. Duranguense may harken back to earlier, simpler times, but it was the Chicago touch that made the tradition sexy, fast and modern.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'}]}],t.name.next("Rise Of Duranguense

to the lore of the historic Chicago venues, and to the hallowed halls of our very own Old Town School of Folk Music.

Folk music, always the people's songs. Come on!",link:"",tabs:[{tabname:"Essay",title:"Folk Music & Chicago",content:"\n            <h5>by Mark Guarino</h5>\n            <p>\n              Long before it earned the name “folk,” stringed instruments and traditional songs accompanied life in Chicago for decades. Labor halls, cafes, radical theaters, and living rooms were all places where fiddlers, banjoists, and guitarists performed on instruments that might have been bought locally through Sears-Roebuck and Company catalog. A major figure in the early century folk movement was Illinois poet Carl Sandburg. Through his 1927 anthology American Songbag and subsequent solo recordings, Sandburg is directly responsible for popularizing traditional songs and making song collecting a serious endeavor. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The galvanizing moment for stringed music in Chicago was April 19, 1924, the opening broadcast of what was then called the Barn Dance, a Saturday night program on WLS that station director Edgar L. Bill promoted as presenting “old-time fiddling, banjo and guitar music and cowboy songs,” the kind of entertainment that he felt a farm audience would appreciate. The broadcast made Chicago the nation’s commercial heart of country music through the end of the Second World War and produced stars like Gene Autry, Bradley Kincaid, Red Foley, Patsy Montana, Lily May Ledford, and Lulu Belle and Scotty, all of whom had prodigious recording careers.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The Barn Dance presented an imagined portrait of rural life through traditional songs, exaggerated characters, and country humor to both remind urban listeners of home and to affirm the traditional values held firm by listeners in rural outposts. Station folklorist John Lair, a native Kentuckian, is responsible for building this downhome fantasia that tied every song, dance routine, instrumental, and minstrel skit to an imagined mountaintop culture devoid of hardship or worry. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              During this period Chicago became home for prestigious music gatherings, starting with the fourth annual National Folk Festival, an international event that used the term “folk” to mean indigenous cultures from the U.S. and abroad. Held at Orchestra Hall in Chicago on May 22-28, 1937, the event represented the first time it traveled north of the Mason-Dixon line. It highlighted folk cultures indigenous to the Midwest. The final night featured the Chicago Negro Group, a special choir of 750 voices featuring song leader Thomas A. Dorsey, the gospel music pioneer.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The Chicagoland Music Festival also took root in downtown Chicago starting in 1930. Held in Soldier Field, the early years were devoted to classical music and the patriotic marches of John Philip Sousa, but in later years it prominently entertainment as diverse as black church choirs from Bronzeville, yodelers, a square dance jamboree featuring 1,000 dancers, and a 78-year-old dulcimer player from Catlettsburg, Kentucky named Aunt Polly Triplett.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Chicago’s folk music scene thrived starting the 1940s during the American folk revival. A catalyst for folk music’s development in Chicago was “I Come for to Sing,” a successful and long-running folk revue in 1947 featuring Big Bill Broonzy, Studs Terkel, folk singer Win Stracke, and tenor Larry Lane that presented traditional folk and blues songs with Elizabethan ballads grouped under different themes that Terkel would highlight with narration. The revue brought folk music to Chicago’s nightclub scene in 1952 when it debuted at the Blue Note, an integrated jazz club on Madison Street. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              That development set the stage for the Gate of Horn, the nation’s first folk music nightclub located in a cellar of the Rice Hotel at 755 N. Dearborn Street. Co-owned by Les Brown, an editor at Downbeat, and Albert Grossman, who would later manage Bob Dylan, the club opened its doors in February 1956. The Gate was meant to appeal to the same well-heeled crowd of after-hours professionals who were packing the downtown supper clubs and jazz lounges that had sprung up that decade. All the marquee artists of the era performed there: Josh White, Big Bill Broonzy, Odetta, Theodore Bikel, Brother John Sellers, Peggy Seeger, Judy Collins, Glenn Yarbrough, Barbara Dane, Martha Schlamme, and others. The Gate served as a showcase for Bob Gibson, one of the most popular artists of the folk revival. Gibson, who grew up in New York but moved to Chicago to play the Gate, was clean-cut, entertaining and slyly risqué – A perfect nightclub act whose virtuoso 12-string guitar playing would influence a later generation of musicians, particularly Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Bob Dylan.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              While the Gate represented the commercial end of the folk boom, the Old Town School of Folk Music represented its traditional counterpart. The school’s founders — Stracke, guitarist Frank Hamilton, organizer Dawn Greening, and administrator Gertrude Soltker, — were opposites in age and temperament, but their efforts created the longest-running folk school of its kind in the U.S. Opening in December 1957, the school would establish a community-based method of teaching based on Bess Lomax Hawes, a pillar of the West Coast folk scene. Instead of the conservancy approach that focused on the individual, the Old Town School emphasized learning by ear though songs, not notes. Instruments were there to accompany the songs and were not a means to an end by themselves, which allowed the music to become a social expression intended to contribute to a heightened sense of community.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              By 1961, folk music concerts were being held throughout Chicago in prestigious venues like Orchestra Hall and the Ravinia Festival. That year the University of Chicago launched its annual folk festival, an event that, for some performers located in the most remote pockets of the rural South like Frank Proffitt, Almeda Riddle, Elizabeth Cotton, and Mississippi Fred McDowell, served as the first time they performed before a large city audience.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The Old Town School is one of the reasons why folk music continued to thrive in Chicago whereas in other places it had died a quick death to rock ‘n’ roll. A second wave of folk singers emerged in the late 1960s and 1970s, a group that included breakout stars John Prine and Steve Goodman. A singer-songwriter scene was sustained through a thriving club scene along Lincoln Avenue and Wells Street, media support like WFMT’s Midnight Special program, and local record labels that nurtured new voices. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n              That lasted into the 1980s, a period when punk rock bands and outsider artists dominated the clubs. Andrew Calhoun’s cooperative label Waterbug Records gave traditional songwriters a home while a bluegrass revival and the launch of “alternative country” bands helped nurture folk-based artists like Andrew Bird, the Handsome Family, Souled American, Chris Mills, the Texas Rubies, Califone, and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, among others. Special Consensus, a four-person bluegrass group that started in 1975, served as a mainstay of bluegrass music throughout this period. Robbie Fulks, a Special Consensus alumni, became the focal point of the singer-songwriter scene starting in the late 1990s. In 2017 he received two Grammy nominations, one for best folk album. The moment shed light on a scene populated by artists who are interested in doing more than uphold tradition. Instead, the one constant running throughout all these periods of Chicago folk music is an allegiance to both experimentation and individualism, a spirit much in line with the city itself.\n
